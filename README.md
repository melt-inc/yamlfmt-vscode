# YAMLfmt for Visual Studio Code

YAMLfmt is a compact, efficient, and **comment-preserving** YAML formatter built on top of [kubernetes-sigs/yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/yaml) and [go-yaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml) ‚Äî the same core code used by [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/).


#### Why this matters

1. It ensures consistency with manifests generated by many popular tools: kubectl, kustomize, helm, etc.
1. It eliminates code churn with [competing formatters](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/12385#issuecomment-1147958026)/styles.

#### But I write YAML for humans, not machines!

Absolutely! That's why YAMLfmt preserves comments, allowing you to communicate and collaborate using meaningful _words_ üòç.
